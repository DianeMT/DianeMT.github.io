## About Me

I am a first year Ph.D. student at [IMT Atlantique](https://www.imt-atlantique.fr/en) (Brest, France) under the supervision of John Puentes and  in collaboration with [Orange Innovation](https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/) (company supervisors : Ahmed Triki and Maxime Laye).

At the intersection of Causality and Machine Learning, my current research project aims to improve decision-support tools with a specific interest in robustness and uncertainty. Having worked as a consultant for a year before starting my Ph.D. funded by this same company, my research is driven by concrete use cases and applications.
